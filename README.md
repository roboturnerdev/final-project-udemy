This project is my final project YelpCamp from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 on Udemy.

I have now completed the project and it is able to be run locally by:

1. navigate to the root directory of the project
2. npm i
3. node app.js

The project is available on localhost:3000/

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. I also enjoy feedback and love to make improvements, so any and everything you think I would value as a response.
