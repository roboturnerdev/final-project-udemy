# UPDATE:

I am so excited to have found Colt Steele as an instructor online. His teaching methods kept me engaged and I was able to comprehend and retain the concepts well. I look forward to taking his React.js course, as well as other important courses like SQL and Data Structures and Algorithms.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. I also enjoy feedback and love to make improvements, so any and everything you think I would value as a response.

# notes

This project is my final project YelpCamp from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 on Udemy.

STACK: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

I have now completed the project and it is able to be run locally by:

1. navigate to the root directory of the project
2. npm i
3. node app.js

The project is available on localhost:3000/

Master will be updated with my project when a section is complete. When I am working in a section, that work is done on a branch called 'section##' and will be merged once the entire section is functional and ready to put to master.
